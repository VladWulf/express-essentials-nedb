# Express.js Essentials template + nedb + sessions

<p>
This is a personal template for quick sketches.
It uses bcrypt, nedb, sessions and pug.
Uses mocha, chai and nodemon for dev.
</p>


## Usage

```
yarn // install packages
yarn start

```


### NB
The project is built with yarn. bcrypt can fail to install if you don't have node-gyp installed globally with yarn.
```
yarn add -g node-gyp
```
